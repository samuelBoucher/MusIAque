Synthesia 0.8.2 (r1507) Full Portable 
=====================================

- Learning Pack cracked/patched

- Serial included but not needed (Already Registered)


Thanks to a guy called voltc who did everything and made it available.

Voltc's original .rar file is in the folder called "Oriinal Files", along with the Synthesia .zip which was downloaded from their website.

I've added a couple of extra well known midi files to the folder.


Instructions for use
====================
Assuming nothing is corrupted and your virus killer hasn't attacked any of the files (I use Kaspersky and AVG), do the following:-

1. Open Synthesia.exe

2. Click on learning pack

3. The padlock should be in the Unlocked position

4. Click back

5. Click Play

6. Have Fun

Well, That's my contribution for this year.

I'll seed until 2x, and hopefully everyone else will do the same, otherwise nobody wins.

clsmoove.

For more support, buy the program, now that i've tried it, i will.
