Initial Setup
-------------

If you downloaded the stand-alone zip package for Windows or are on a Mac, you
need to set up the song library for the first time:

1. If you didn't extract the "music" folder from the package you downloaded,
   put it someplace convenient like the Music folder in your Documents or
   profile directory.

2. Start Synthesia.

3. From the title screen, click Play to open the song library.

4. Click "Managed Watched Folders".

5. Click "Add New Watched Folder".

6. Navigate to the location you extracted the music folder from the Synthesia
   package.

7. Double-click the "music" folder.

8. Click "Watch this folder and all sub-folders".

That should be it. Tap escape a couple times to get back to the song
library. There should now be over a hundred songs in there.


Adding New Songs
----------------

From now on, whenever you download a MIDI file from the Internet, you can just
drop it in the same music folder wherever you extracted it, and it will show
up in the song library the next time you run Synthesia.

(If you used the Windows installer, there will be a "Synthesia Music" folder
inside your Documents folder.)
